<h1>Guide</h1>
<p>We're bringing you a fresh version of our Performances FAQ, previously known as our Live Virtual Concert Guide.</p>

<h2>Before the Performance</h2>
<p>Please <a class="link" href="{% url 'signups:events' %}">sign up</a> for an event!</p>
<h2>On Performance Day</h2>
<p>Arrive to the Streamyard link (provided a few days ahead of the performance) 30 minutes before for a sound
    check. We want to make sure we'll be able to hear you when you play! For more information on using Streamyard,
    please visit <a class="link" href="https://support.streamyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043291612">Guest
    instructions â€“ StreamYard</a>.</p>
<p>When you first join the "broadcast studio", only the hosts will be able to see you. No one will be able to hear
    you, so you're welcome to warm up before your performance, but we ask that your camera remains on the whole
    time. We'll provide a YouTube livestream link a few days ahead of time. Share it with your family and friends
    so our performers can have an audience!</p>
<p>We'll add you to the broadcast when it's your turn and the host will introduce you, but also introduce yourself!
    (ex. "Hi everyone! My name is [name], I'm [age] years old, and today I will be performing [piece].") After you
    play, make sure to bow at the end.</p>
<h2>After the Performance</h2>
<p>This activity is worth 1.5 SSL hours on your log, although we are allowed to adjust your hours at our
    discretion. Share and subscribe to our YouTube channel for other performances!</p>
<p>If you have friends who'd like to perform, have them fill out the <a class="link"
